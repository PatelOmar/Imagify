# Design Notes:
## Technologies used:
  **React.js, Node js, Firebase**
## React.js
  For my front end I used React.js as it is one of the most powerful javascript libraries. I used it for it's resusable components which can be update the DOM when there is a change in the back end.
  
## Firebase
### Firebase Auth
  Used google authentication for secure uploading and identification of stored images. Also able to Authenticate using other services quickly and roll it out within minutes.
### Firebase Storage
  Used Firebase storage to store images of various types without having to worry about validation before upload, and receive a download url to store and display in gallery.
#### Limitations:
